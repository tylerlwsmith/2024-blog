# 2024 Blog Site (WIP)

This repository is a work-in-progress. Its intention is to use features from Docker and the WordPress CLI to paper over missing features like a plugin manifest (example: `package.json` or `requirements.txt`), and predefined pages. Ideally, another developer should be able to clone this repo and have all the required plugins and static pages for this site. This is most important for a headless WordPress installation where another application may depend on certain pages already existing.
